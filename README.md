Task 1: Collatz Conjecture Verifier

Progam aim:
The task at hand is to verify, using Python, that the Collatz conjecture holds true for the first 10,000 positive integers

Explanation:
The Python script Task1.py contains a function Collatz(n) that generates the Collatz sequence for a given integer. The main loop then goes through the first 10,000 positive integers, sending them into two lists (True, false) based on whether the Collatz conjecture holds true or false.

How to run:
To run the code run: python Task1.py in your terminal. 

What happens: 
The terminal should then list which integers hold true before listing those which are false.
