    "Task 1: The Collatz conjecture1 is a famous unsolved problem in mathematics. The problem is to prove that if you start with any positive integer x and repeatedly apply the function f(x) below, you al ways get stuck in the repeating sequence 1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, . . .\n",

Then we repeatedly divide by 2 to get 8, 4, 2, 1. Once we are at 1, we go back to 4 and get stuck in the repeating sequence 4, 2, 1 as we suspected.\n",
