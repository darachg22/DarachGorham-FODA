#Task1
#The Collatz conjecture1 is a famous unsolved problem in mathematics. The problem is to prove that if you start with any positive integer x and repeatedly apply the function f(x) below, you al ways get stuck in the repeating sequence 1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, . . .
#f(x) =
#x รท 2 if x is even
#3x + 1 otherwise
#For example, starting with the value 10, which is an even number, we divide it by 2 to get 5. Then 5 is an odd number so, we mul tiply by 3 and add 1 to get 16. Then we repeatedly divide by 2 to get 8, 4, 2, 1. Once we are at 1, we go back to 4 and get stuck in the repeating sequence 4, 2, 1 as we suspected.
#Your task is to verify, using Python, that the conjecture is true for the first 10,000 positive integers


#My code which I completed last semester that returns the numbers found: 
def Collatz(n):
    out=[n]
    while n>1:
        if n%2==0:
           n = n//2
        else:
            n = (n*3)+1
        out.append(int(n))
    return out

n = int(input("Enter a number:"))
result = Collatz(n)
print(*result)

#I now need to alter the code to fit the brief i.e.verify, using Python, that the conjecture is true for the first 10,000 positive integers
